Data-driven researcher who is passionate about collaboration, innovation, and leveraging machine learning in healthcare. I contribute to cutting-edge projects at the NERVES Lab and the Utah NeuroRobotics Lab at the University of Utah. I have designed wireless sEMG chips and programs to process body-worn sensor signals automatically. I have worked with complex machine learning systems for neuroprosthesis. Currently working to create a system that uses reinforcement learning to predict real-time gait transitions over difficult terrain. Seeking opportunities to develop my expertise in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning and drive impactful research through collaborative endeavors. Let's innovate together! #Innovation #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #AI #DataScience
